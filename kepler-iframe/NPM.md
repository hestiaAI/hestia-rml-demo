For a first test, I started by creating a package with my personal npm user andreaskundig, to @andreaskundig/kepler-iframe.

    npm publish --access public

The package can be loaded from any webpage through [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):

https://unpkg.com/@andreaskundig/kepler-iframe@1.0.0/index.js
