# Goal

We want a multilingual site to which a client like UFC can add his own translations.

Translations live in these places:
- **site translations** default translations for the nuxt site: [experiences//i18n-messages-default.json](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/feat/i18n/experiences/i18n-messages-default.json)
- **experience translations**, default translations for each experience, for example in [packages/packages/google/src/index.ts](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/feat/i18n/packages/packages/google/src/index.ts#L10)
- **custom translations** loaded from an url defined in the config, for example at [experiences/static/i18n-messages-example.json](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/feat/i18n/experiences/static/i18n-messages-example.json)

**site** and **experience** translations affect different texts.
**custom translations** can override any translation of the other two.

# Integration with UFC

In addition to wanting a french version of experiences, UFC wants to be able to edit the introduction text of each experience from their a cms. This solution relies on translations being loaded in a specific json format from a url.

In our first discussion with UFC, we imagined that the cms would produce html that could be included in an iframe. I hope it's possible to have it as an html snippet rather than a whole html page like iframes normally work with. It's possible that they imagined having a different url for the introduction text for each experience. If they absolutely need to do that, we could implement a function that converts their format to ours.

# Usage

Define text snippets in the vue-i18n format. This is the content of [i18n-messages-example.json](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/feat/i18n/experiences/static/i18n-messages-example.json), a custom translation that changes only the french translation.
```json
{
  "en": {
    "welcome": "Welcome"
  },
  "fr": {
    "welcome": "Bienvenue",
    "experience": {
      "intro": {
        "title": "Analysez vos données privées"
      }
    },
    "experiences": {
      "google": {
        "intro": {
          "dataPortalHtml": "Cliquez <a href=\"https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout\">ici</a>",
          "dataPortalMessage": "<strong>Important:</strong> pour que l'expérience"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The translations are used in [UnitIntroduction.vue](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/88f205b92661460a96b71bb4dd3e5df631ac1c69/experiences/components/unit/UnitIntroduction.vue)

Site translations are used by calling the [$t function from vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/api/#vue-injected-methods)
``` html
      <VCardTitle class="text-h5 font-weight-bold justify-center mb-3">
        {{ $t('experience.intro.title') }}
      </VCardTitle>
```

Experience translations are used in similar way, although the t function is implemented by us.
```html
            <p
              v-else-if="t('dataPortalHtml')"
              class="body-1"
              v-html="t('dataPortalHtml')"
            />
```
# Implementation

The default messages are loaded at build time by [nuxt.config.js](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/88f205b92661460a96b71bb4dd3e5df631ac1c69/experiences/nuxt.config.js#L21)

The custom messages are loaded by the browser, in [experiences/layouts/default.vue](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/88f205b92661460a96b71bb4dd3e5df631ac1c69/experiences/layouts/default.vue#L99)

The experience message are loaded by components like TheDataExperience.vue and it's children. The proof of concept is implemented in [UnitIntroduction.vue](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/88f205b92661460a96b71bb4dd3e5df631ac1c69/experiences/components/unit/UnitIntroduction.vue#L133). The translation method t is implemented on that component. Note that multilingual messages for experience blocks still need to be done.
```js
  methods: {
    t(key) {
      const experienceName = this.$route.params.experience
      const i18nKey = `experiences.${experienceName}.intro.${key}`
      if (this.$i18n.te(i18nKey)) {
        return this.$i18n.t(i18nKey)
      }
      // TODO try to find localized text in experience
      return this[key]
    },
```

The [dev.json](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/88f205b92661460a96b71bb4dd3e5df631ac1c69/experiences/config/dev.json#L63)
has an example of a **locale** set to french and an **url** to load custom translations.

The custom translation example [configures](https://github.com/hestiaAI/hestialabs-experiences/blob/88f205b92661460a96b71bb4dd3e5df631ac1c69/experiences/static/i18n-messages-example.json#L13) the introduction to the google experience

Here's a direct link to the google experience running locally.

# Design considerations

The format of experience translations needs to be defined, for example in a messages.json file that uses the same format as vue-i18n.

I don't think it's necessary to keep the format backwards compatible. We could just remove properties like dataPortalHtml and dataPortalMessage and move them to the messages.json file

It would be nice if our t function could be defined once and reused in all experience components. The one in this proof of context would not be accessible in TheDataExperience.vue or UnitQuery.vue

# Bugs

nuxt-i18n changes the behavior of the router and its components like nuxt-link. Currently the links in the menu are broken. Hopefully this can be fixed by configuring nuxt-i18n [in some way](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/ignoring-localized-routes)
