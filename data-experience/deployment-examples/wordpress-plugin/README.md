# Deploying this plugin

## Upload plugin to wordpress

Zip the files in this folder and upload the zip to plugins in the [wordpress dashboard](https://themewaves.com/how-to-upload-plugin-to-wordpress/)
https://themewaves.com/how-to-upload-plugin-to-wordpress/

Alternatively, you can upload this folder to wordpress's plugin directory with [FTP](https://www.wonderplugin.com/wordpress-tutorials/how-to-manually-install-a-wordpress-plugin-via-ftp/)

## Create a new page

Add content with the shortcode [dataexperience]. By default this will show the uber-driver experience, but you can change it to another like this: [dataexperience experience="twitter"]

# Development

The plugin is based on this [tutorial](https://dev.to/workingwebsites/using-vue-in-wordpress-1b9l)

I used [InstantWP](https://instantwp.com/) to test this locally. On windows, remember to start it with Start-InstantWP.bat
